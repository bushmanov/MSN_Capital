    "- Data is reported on Fridays, with a single report per Company (if available) per given day\n",
    "- Data is more or less evenly distributed for test (Jan 2016 -- Sep 2019) and train (Aug 2004 -- Dec 2015)\n",
    "- Reporting periods for a given Company  may span from 7 days (consistent weekly reporting) to any multiple of 7 (gaps from a week to a year+)\n",
    "- A gap doesn't guarantee there was no reporting in the period (a 9m gap --> report of an insider trading within 6m --> no current or previous report for a shorter period)\n",
    "- Number of reports per Company id spans from 1 to 195 in test and to 595 in train\n",
    "- 9695 stocks in train and 4966 in test\n",
    "- 24% of Companies in test don't have history in train\n",
    "- 112 Companies in test are single datapoint, with 59 out of them not having history in train\n",

    "    - **Target mean encoding**. For a certain datapoint we embed a feature representing historical 1m, 3m, 6m, 12m performance. Due to (i) the way target is constructed, i.e. it's 12m forward looking, and (ii) a 3 year ahead performance prediction was asked, target encoding was shifted 3 years back, i.e. we are embedding 3y-1m, 3y-3m, 3y-6m, 3y-1m target means, which is obviously suboptimal.\n",

    "    - **Clustering**. Stocks seem to belong to highly heterogeneous groups, with sell/buy counts ranging from low single digits to multiples of $10^{15}$. Thus clustering was suggested to put similar stocks together. Clustering was done on every possible feature pair, after features normalization, which ensures even stock distribution among different clusters:\n",

    "- Target mean encoding was done on the whole dataset, all the rest feature engineering was put into a **pipeline**:  \n",
